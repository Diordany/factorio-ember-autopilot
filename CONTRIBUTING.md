# Overview

I'm not entirely sure yet how I want to manage future contributions exactly yet, but I'll try to refine the guidelines along the way.

# Pull Requests

When submitting pull requests to this repository, please keep the following things in mind:

- Try to keep your patches as small as necessary, bigger and complex (or obscure) patches will probably take more time to review.
- If your patch is unfinished, submit it as a draft, we may work our way up from there.
- Try to stick to one subject per pull request if possible.
- If you don't want to commit to development right away, open up a [discussion](https://github.com/Diordany/factorio-ember-autopilot/discussions/categories/ideas) or an [issue](https://github.com/Diordany/factorio-ember-autopilot/issues) related to your idea.
